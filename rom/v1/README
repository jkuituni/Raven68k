For posterity...

The m68k.ld, crt0.S, and Makefile originally came from a blog post 
at http://bitsnbikes.blogspot.com/2010/02/das-blinklicht-with-gcc-elf-m68k.html
which was linked to comp.sys.m68k newsgroup at
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/comp.sys.m68k/nupIo9ypu2E

This code requires srecord to be installed to do the conversion from SREC format
to writable ROMs.
