This directory holds the validation test benches used to make sure the code worked.

You can use these by elaborating and running with ghdl, then viewing through GTKWave.

Ex:
	Check Syntax:	ghdl -s --ieee=synopsys tb_dtack.vhd dtack.vhd
	Analyze:	ghdl -a --ieee=synopsys tb_dtack.vhd dtack.vhd
	Elaborate:	ghdl -e --ieee=synopsys tb_dtack		<-- this is the entity name
	Simulate:	ghdl -r --ieee=synopsys tb_dtack --vcd=tb_dtack.vcd --stop-time=500ms
	View:		gtkwave tb_dtack.vcd

Note that OSX versions of GTKWave do not seem to act properly. Open GTK manually, then
File -> Open New Tab, then naviate to tb_dtack.vcd
